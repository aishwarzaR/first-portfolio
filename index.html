            <p>Scope of Placements In CSE: With every business and organization going digital, the IT sector today is a
                booming field as compared to other sectors and there is a huge demand of Computer Science Engineers and
                programmers. The demand is so high that IT companies recruit engineers not only from the Computer
                Science and IT branch but also from other branches like Electrical, Electronics, and Mechanical.
                However, engineers who have pursued CSE will have an edge over engineers from other streams because of
                the knowledge and skills they gather in college. There is a huge scope of placements in CSE. In fact, it
                has taken the top position in placements as compared to the other fields.</p>
